**About Chico**

Chico tells your story through your financial transaction history. We track your spending habits, verify your financial situation, and learn your behaviors so financial institutions can give you better recommendations, cheaper credit, and help you spend smarter.

We are enabling universal access to credit and helping bank millions of people by unlocking the data potential of Latin America's financial markets.

While 67% of Brazilians remain underbanked, banks fail to help them. Demand is not an issue. Supply is.

Credit scores paint a picture of the past. A traditional credit bureau consists of a database on past credit behavior. Whether you’ve paid loans on time, where you live, what is your appetite for borrowing, but it doesn’t capture your fundamental financial health. With open banking data, the most up to date financial information about you, we can meet you where you are.

Our pre-trained models let financial institutions track your spending habits, verify your financial situation, and learn your behaviors. We **trained our models on over 500M transactions and 1M individuals.** We allow financial institutions to replicate the ML development flow of companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Our models can be easily plugged in and fine-tuned for classical models used by customers.

As of today, our models are helping 5 design partners tell the stories of 30M+ individuals. That includes 3 of the top 10 neobanks, a relevant BNPL player, and a leading PFM. We are learning together how to apply our stories to credit, product recommendations, and helping users have a healthier financial life.

**Why now?**

Latin America is undergoing a financial revolution, catching up to the Open Finance movement and legislation that happened in the US and the EU.

With the new Open Banking legislation, people are going to be able to share their data across financial institutions. Six months from now companies from all industries will be able to access the same type of data that is available to banks.

By looking at how open banking changed the European and UK landscape, we can assume the top 5 banks in Brazil can lose up to 90 billion dollars in annual revenue. This is the time to do it.

By becoming the intelligence layer for the open banking stack, we are the best positioned to become the aggregator for the LatAm financial markets.

As we verticalize to integrate with smaller players, the end-user will join our platform. Since from our models we know exactly what products are best for them and they are able to acquire. We can deliver to them the best financial products at the right time.

[Felipe Meneses](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipebpm/)

Felipe is a Brazilian technologist with a deep understanding of machine learning systems. When he was sixteen, he turned down an offer to pursue a master's degree at IMPA so he could go to Stanford to study computer science and math where he took enough classes to have gotten a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. In 2017 he joined the founding team of Zippi, a credit fintech, and entered the YC S19 batch. He dropped out of Stanford a year later because he believed he could learn more by starting a business. He started _init_, a pull request orchestrator to help engineers review PRs faster.

**What you bring to the table**

-   Ample ML research experience, in academia or industry, developing highly scalable models, and handling large amounts of data
-   A history of ideating and leading ambitious research projects inspired by real-world challenges
-   Exceptional communication with technical and non-technical audiences 
-   Comfort with ambiguity; ability to thrive with minimal oversight and process
-   We use Spark, PyTorch and Python a lot, so knowing these things helps. However, we know that great engineers are not defined by tools,  so other technologies are certainly on the table.
